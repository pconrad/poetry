# A Solliloquy of Marc Antony

O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers

Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever livéd in the tide of times

Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
over their wounds now do I prophesy

A bunch of REALLY bad things will happen in Rome
Blood and desruction will be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar


Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
